# Markdiary

A terrible name for a project I am starting. Going to be a place to log in to an account and have saved markdown documents available to you, or the ability to just use the markdown editor as a guest! Simple app, but going tobe nice React experience, but also a good place to utilize authorization and practice my Node.js skills.
